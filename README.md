# CSCI-476
A collection of bits of code for assignments in CSCI 476, Computer Security.

## Assignment 1
A very manual tool used to solve a simple cipher where each letter is replaced by another. This was a "guess and check" sort of assignment.

## Assignment 2
A program which sifts through a memory dump and prints any credit card information in a nice, readable format. It only checks for track 1 card information.

## Assignment 3
A simple dictionary* password cracker! Only attempts to break MD5 hashes.

**Dictionary not included.*

## Assignment 4
A program which reads a PCAP file and searches for any potential SYN attacks. I had to modify a library I used, just a little, to filter out irrelevant packets before storing them in RAM, as the file provided was quite large and the data type used was rather inefficient.
